# Fake-News-Detection

In this project, we discuss the use of Natural
Language Processing techniques to recognise when fake news
may be generated by a news source. We use acorpus of labeled
real and fake news articles to create a classifier that can make
information-based decisions based on the corpus data. Using
four different classification models, we use a text classification
approach and analyze the results. Out of Naive Bayes, SVM,
Nueral Network and LSTM, LSTM implementation was the
best performing design. The model focuses on identifying false
sources of news, based on multiple reports from a source. Once
a source is labeled as a fake news producer, we can confidently
predict that any future articles from that source will be
fake news as well. Focusing on sources expands our articleâ€™s
tolerance for misclassification, as we then have multiple data
points from each source.
